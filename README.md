# Hi, I'm Prasad  
AI/ML Engineer | GenAI Developer | Computer Vision and Deep Learning Specialist  

I build systems that learn, reason, and solve real-world problems.  
My work spans across real-time computer vision models, multimodal LLM systems, OCR automation, and 3D deep-learning pipelines.  
I enjoy transforming raw data into scalable, production-ready AI applications.
